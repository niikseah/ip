# Use of AI

In this iP, I tried using Gemini and Cursor in my project. Whilst both platforms are excellent at implementing and improving code when given a prompt, I noticed that further prompts are required to refine code outputs. This is not a problem in Gemini as it does not edit the code automatically, and code output will be generated and it is up to user discretion whether they want to include it. However, Cursor edits the code automatically. This can be seen as convenient and efficient, but in cases where the prompt given is misinterpreted or incomplete, it can be a hassle to solve this issue. There is a convenient way of reverting back to the code's original state, but I realise that this may not be the case for cases where GitHub is involved. Such changes made makes it hard for the user to undo, and it can be anxiety-inducing for novice users. 

Ultimately, I believe that AI can be used as a tool instead of a replacement for humans. While it saved a lot of time that would have been spent hard-coding, a human supervisor is still necessary to ensure requirements are fulfilled. For students like myself, I believe it is an excellent tool in learning, as it can explain and help in coding. This remains a slippery slope where one might become over-reliant on such tools and fall victim to becoming lazy, and this is something I am diligently remaining conscious of.
